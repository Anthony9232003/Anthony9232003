# Hi, I'm Anthony 👋

🎓 I'm an **Economics and Statistics double major at UNC Charlotte** working to connect what I learn in class with real-world data and quantitative finance.  
💻 I’m currently building projects in **Python** to explore topics like econometrics, optimization, and market modeling.  
📈 I don’t have everything figured out yet — I’m still learning, experimenting, and making mistakes — but I’m genuinely curious about how math and data shapes financial decisions.

---

### 🌱 What I’m Learning
- Python fundamentals and data analysis (NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib)
- Basic econometrics and regression modeling
- Monte Carlo simulation and risk metrics
- How quantitative finance connects economics, math, and computing

---

### 🧩 Current Projects
- **Monte Carlo Portfolio Simulator** — experimenting with random walks and portfolio risk visualization  
- **Expected Utility Visualizer** — exploring how risk aversion changes decision-making  
- **CAPM Regression Practice** — using sample stock data to understand beta and returns  

*(I’m keeping these projects simple for now and improving them as I learn more!)*

---

### 🧠 Skills I’m Developing
**Programming:** Python, R, SQL  
**Concepts:** Econometrics, Probability, Optimization, Finance Fundamentals  
**Tools:** Jupyter, Git, Excel, Matplotlib, pandas

---

### 🎯 Goals for This Year
- Finish my first full data analysis project from start to finish  
- Get more comfortable reading financial data and interpreting models  
- Connect with others interested in quant, finance, and data science
